# Required set-up for the course {-}

The user will need to install several `R` packages to carry out the modules. This can be accomplished with the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse",
                 "ratdat",
                 "ecorest",
                 "EngrEcon",
                 "knitr"))
```
