Model assumptions
https://janhove.github.io/posts/2019-04-11-assumptions-relevance/

## Learning Objectives: 
* Learn the purpose and structure of a linear model
* Learn how to run a linear model in R
* Learn how to understand the output of a linear model
* Learn how to interpret linear model validity

## Lecture:
* Purpose of using linear models in the context of USACE
  + Linear models determine the relationship between variables
  + Linear models can e.g., examine how habitat characteristics correlate with organism presence/abundance or other ecosystem components, key to restoration
* Components/equation of a linear model
  + Response variable
  + Predictor variables
    - Continuos predictors
    - Categorical predictors
    - Error:Graphical illustration of residuals and underscore their importance for allude to importance for assessing validity of lm() approach
* Linear model output
  + Intercepts
  + Slopes
  + Amount of variance explained
* Predicting values
* Important assumptions of linear models (Gelman & Hill)
  + How to think about these assumptions: less as mathematical rules, more as things that, when violated, may make the inferences less relevant 
  + Validity: the data should map to the research question
  + Additivity and linearity: deterministic component is a linear function of the separate predictors
  + Independence of errors: residuals not autocorrelated
  + Equal variance of errors
  + Normality of errors

## Coding mechanics and application
* Use lm() for linear regression with subset of Upper Miss. data
* Assess model assumptions using gglm package to make diagnostic plots
  + Residuals vs. fitted for linear relationship
  + Normal Q-Q for normal distribution of residuals
  + Scale-location for equal variance of errors
  + Residuals vs. leverage for influential points
* Interpret model output
