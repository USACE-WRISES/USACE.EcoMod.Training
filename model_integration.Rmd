Integrating physical and biological models

This section designed to synthesize many components of the training

Eflows case studies
NY Bight Ecological model example

Floodplain inundation -> Flow metrics -> biological model
- Take eco-value curve
- Generate flow metrics about duration of inundation
- Plug into ecological model
