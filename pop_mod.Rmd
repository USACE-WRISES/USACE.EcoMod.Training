## Course outline

* Population modeling
  + Background on population modeling, drawing from:
    - Primer of Ecology using R (https://hankstevens.github.io/Primer-of-Ecology/expo.html)
    - Modeling Population Growth module from UNL (https://dshizuka.github.io/RCourse/09.2.PopGrowth.html)
  + Density independent growth
  + Density-independent demography
  + Density dependent growth
  + Populations in space
  + Use simple analyses in Wenger et al. (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ece3.9339) to demonstrate relating poulations to environmental covariates
